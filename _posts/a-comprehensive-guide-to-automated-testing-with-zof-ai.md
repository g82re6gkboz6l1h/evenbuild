## What is Automated Testing?

Automated testing employs software tools to execute tests on applications, comparing actual results with expected ones. It eliminates repetitive manual tasks while enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Key types of tests you can automate include:

- **Functional Testing:** Validates that software works according to requirements.
- **Regression Testing:** Catches potential issues due to new code changes.
- **Performance Testing:** Assesses responsiveness under various conditions.
- **UI Testing:** Verifies optimal user interface and consistency across platforms.

Transitioning from manual to automated testing can be challenging, but **Zof AI** simplifies the process with its powerful, user-friendly QA solution.
