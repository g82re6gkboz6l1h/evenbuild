## What is QA Automation?

QA Automation utilizes software tools to automate the execution of test cases, improving testing accuracy and efficiency. Unlike manual testing, which requires human input at every step, automated QA—especially with AI-based innovations like Zof AI—provides scalability by handling complex and repetitive tasks effortlessly. 

Zof AI stands apart with its ability to adapt dynamically to application changes through AI-driven analytics and learning. This ensures QA teams can focus on high-value tasks while the platform handles the intricate processes of testing for functionality, regression, or compatibility.
