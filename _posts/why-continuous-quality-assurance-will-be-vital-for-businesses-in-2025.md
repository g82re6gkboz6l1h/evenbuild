## What is Continuous QA?

Continuous QA encompasses testing throughout the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Unlike traditional QA approaches confined to fixed stages, it adopts an iterative process with testing embedded at every point—from code updates to deployments—to ensure seamless quality. 

### Key Features of Continuous QA:
- **Automation-Driven Testing**: Reduces manual efforts through automated tools.
- **Real-Time Feedback Systems**: Tackles bugs instantly, minimizing risk and inefficiencies.
- **Integration in CI/CD Pipelines**: Syncs quality assurance with Agile and DevOps frameworks.

As rapid development cycles become the norm, Continuous QA ensures businesses consistently deliver high-quality ecosystems tailored to customer demands.
