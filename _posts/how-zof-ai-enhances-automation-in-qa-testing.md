## The Need for Automation in QA Testing

Manual testing, while effective in certain scenarios, has limitations that hinder its scalability and efficiency. Automated QA testing accelerates testing cycles, ensures consistency, and delivers broader test coverage. However, traditional automation has challenges of its own—extensive scripting, lack of adaptability, and slow responsiveness to changes in software. Enter **AI-powered QA tools** like Zof AI, which overcome these shortfalls with advanced self-learning, adaptability, and predictive capabilities.
