## 1. Common QA Challenges Faced by Teams

QA teams encounter obstacles such as ineffective bug tracking, repetitive tasks, limited test coverage, and manual processes that lead to missed deadlines. Reactive frameworks also hinder resilience. Addressing these issues is crucial for achieving efficient QA workflows.

### Ineffective Bug Tracking

Traditional bug tracking systems often struggle with detailed logging, prioritizing fixes, and maintaining issue visibility.

### Time-Consuming Repetitive Tasks

Manual regression testing and validation consume valuable time, restricting strategic development.

### Limited Test Coverage

Teams lack tools to test edge cases thoroughly, leading to gaps in quality.

### Missed Deadlines

Manual QA workflows slow down delivery in fast-paced environments.

### Difficulty in Building Resilience

Reactive systems fail to adapt, particularly when scaling development.

These challenges stress the need for tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) to optimize efficiency and elevate software quality.
