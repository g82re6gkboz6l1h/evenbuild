## Why AI is Disrupting Software Testing

Software testing has traditionally been a bottleneck in the development cycle, requiring extensive manual effort and lengthy execution times. Automation tools helped streamline testing but came with challenges when handling edge cases or adapting to dynamic application changes. Today, AI is bridging these gaps:

### AI vs. Traditional Testing

- **Automation Limitations**: Predefined testing scripts struggle to adapt to application updates.
- **AI Advantages**: Machine-learning models dynamically recognize patterns, behaviors, and system changes, enabling better test coverage and predictive bug detection.
