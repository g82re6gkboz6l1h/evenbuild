## What is AI-Powered QA?

AI-powered Quality Assurance leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate and enhance testing processes. Unlike traditional QA, AI-powered workflows rely on intelligent systems to detect patterns, predict bugs, and adapt in real-time. These systems operate beyond static scripts, constantly learning from historical data to refine the testing process.

By 2025, AI will become an integral part of QA systems, reducing reliance on manual work while empowering teams to deliver faster, higher-quality software.
