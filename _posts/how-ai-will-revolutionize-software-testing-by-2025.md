## What Does AI Bring to QA?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves systems capable of mimicking human intelligence. In QA, AI manifests through automation, predictive analytics, and machine learning (ML), optimizing processes traditionally conducted with heavy manual input. Traditional testing requires time and effort, making it error-prone. In contrast, AI-driven QA boosts precision and efficiency by analyzing patterns, predicting bugs, and automating repeatable tasks.

Technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning allow AI to identify high-risk areas in applications and mimic real-world software usage scenarios. By making manual testing redundant, tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are revolutionizing modern workflows.
