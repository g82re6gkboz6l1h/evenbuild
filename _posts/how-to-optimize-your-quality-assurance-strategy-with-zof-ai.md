## Common Challenges in Traditional QA

### 1. **Manual Testing Takes Too Long**
Manual testing processes are labor-intensive, slowing teams down as they juggle repetitive execution, documentation, and debugging tasks.

### 2. **Scaling Across Platforms Is Tough**
Modern applications must run flawlessly across numerous devices, systems, and browsers. Traditional methods struggle to achieve this scalability.

### 3. **Human Errors Persist**
Even expert testers may overlook bugs or fail to identify edge cases, leading to costly post-release corrections.

### 4. **Expensive Teams**
Building, training, and maintaining a large QA team leads to high operational costs, especially for companies handling multiple projects.

To address these pain points, switch to AI-powered methodologies today with Zof AI.
