## What is Regression Testing & Why It’s Essential?

Regression testing ensures software updates or enhancements do not interfere with existing functionality. In today’s rapid development cycles, changes risk introducing defects, making regression testing indispensable.

### Why Regression Testing Matters:
1. **Stability:** Maintains the software’s functionality post updates.
2. **Error Detection:** Identifies hidden defects linked to changes.
3. **User Retention:** Builds user trust via reliable applications.
4. **Support for Continuous Integration:** Enables agile methodologies to thrive.

Without effective regression testing, errors could impact system reliability, leading to frustrated users, reputational harm, and unplanned expenses.

## Challenges in Traditional Regression Testing

While crucial, conventional regression testing presents these roadblocks:

1. **Labor-Intensive & Time-Consuming:** Manual reviews and frequent updates hinder faster release cycles, even with automation.
2. **Complexity:** Testing compatibility across multiple functionalities becomes daunting for large applications.
3. **Maintenance Overheads:** Constant script updates to fit evolving systems drain resources.
4. **Limited Scalability:** Growing applications require endless cycles, causing bottlenecks.
5. **Inconsistent Accuracy:** False positives or negatives reduce reliability.

Addressing these issues, AI-powered approaches like Zof AI provide practical solutions for QA teams working under tight deadlines.
