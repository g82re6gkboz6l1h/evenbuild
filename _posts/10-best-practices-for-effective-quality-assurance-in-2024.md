## 1. Understanding the Fundamentals of QA

**Quality Assurance** is about more than testing; it’s a methodology focused on **detecting and preventing defects** before software reaches end-users. QA integrates into every phase of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to establish standards for quality and performance.

### Key Components of QA:
- **Planning**: Clear quality goals and structured strategies.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive automated and manual tests.
- **Monitoring & Analysis**: Vigilant identification of inefficiencies.

Well-executed QA enhances your software’s **usability, reliability, and performance**, leading to better customer satisfaction and business success.
