## 2. Balanced Approach: Functional & Non-Functional Testing

QA teams excel by mastering **functional** and **non-functional** testing. While functional testing checks if features align with business objectives, non-functional testing evaluates performance, usability, and security. Combining both approaches ensures end products are not only functional but robust across diverse environments.
