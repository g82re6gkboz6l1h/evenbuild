## How AI is Transforming Quality Assurance

Historically, QA relied on manual testing or semi-automated tools often falling short in today's fast-paced environments. Challenges included delayed testing cycles, high costs, human dependency, and defects slipping through production. AI addresses these issues by enabling faster, smarter, and predictive QA processes.

AI-powered tools, like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), enhance QA with:

- Automated test case generation and execution.
- Predictive analytics to anticipate code vulnerabilities.
- Adaptive learning from historical data.

These advancements not only reduce operational costs but empower QA teams to focus on strategic priorities instead of repetitive, time-intensive tasks.
