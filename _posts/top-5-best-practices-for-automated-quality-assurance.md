## What Is Automated Quality Assurance?
Automated QA uses scripts and tools to test applications faster and more consistently than manual testing. With growing software complexity, manual testing alone is insufficient. Automation ensures swift feedback cycles, though human intervention remains critical for strategy, refinement, and validation.

Follow these core practices to maximize automated QA outcomes.
