## How Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizes QA

Quality Assurance has historically relied on manual testing and simplistic automation tools. However, as systems grow more intricate, so do QA challenges. AI employs machine learning, natural language processing, and analytics to automate tasks, identify irregularities, and streamline procedures with unparalleled precision. Here’s how AI redefines QA:

- **Autonomous Test Creation** using AI models reduces manual workloads.
- **In-Depth Anomaly Detection**, uncovering irregularities often missed.
- **Predictive Analytics to Proactively Address Issues**, minimizing future risks.
- **Adaptive Testing Protocols**, continuously aligning with evolving business demands.

AI doesn’t just detect errors; it fosters smarter, more adaptive, and resilient systems.
