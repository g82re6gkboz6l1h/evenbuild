## QA Testing Evolution: How AI is Changing the Game

Historically, QA relied on manual processes, often prone to delays and errors. While automated tools reduced efforts, they're still resource-heavy when it comes to script creation and updates. AI disrupts this approach by leveraging machine learning (ML) for scalability, predictive analytics, and real-world application modeling.

Zof AI specializes in integrating advanced AI-driven solutions, automating repetitive tasks with intelligent algorithms. By 2025, its transformative impact is undeniable, driving efficiency and precision in QA workflows.
