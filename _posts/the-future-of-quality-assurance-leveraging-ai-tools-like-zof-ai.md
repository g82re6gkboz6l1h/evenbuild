## The Evolution of QA Testing

Two decades ago, QA testing was manual, resource-intensive, and prone to human error. Automated tools like Selenium and Appium sparked revolutionary changes, transforming repetitive tasks into efficient, reusable processes. However, these tools struggle with scalability and adaptability in today’s fast-paced software cycles, particularly in agile and DevOps environments. 

Artificial intelligence presents the next frontier. By introducing machine learning techniques, intelligent automation, and predictive analytics, AI provides speed and accuracy that far surpass manual and conventional automated methods.
