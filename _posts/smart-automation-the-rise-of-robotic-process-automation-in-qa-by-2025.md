## What Is Smart Automation in QA?

Smart automation integrates advanced AI and RPA technologies to create intelligent systems capable of independent decision-making, adapting to changing requirements, and optimizing workflows. Unlike traditional manual testing or basic automation tools such as Selenium, **AI-powered RPA** enhances QA processes by:

1. **Analyzing Software Behavior**: Detecting patterns and anomalies in various test scenarios.
2. **Automating Complex Workflows**: Handling repetitive tasks like UI testing, regression, and stress testing autonomously.
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Reacting to real-time code changes and evolving requirements.

In today's accelerated development cycles, the demand for smart QA automation cannot be overstated.
