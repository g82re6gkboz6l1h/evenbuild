## What is Quality Assurance and Why It Matters?

Quality Assurance ensures high standards are met during the product lifecycle by identifying potential problems early. Unlike Quality Control (QC), which detects flaws after production, QA is a proactive measure for ensuring consistent quality at every stage.

### Benefits of QA:
1. **Improved Customer Satisfaction**: Delivers reliable products that meet expectations.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Aligns with legal and industry protocols.
3. **Cost Savings**: Fixing issues early reduces post-release costs.
4. **Enhanced Reputation**: High-quality output builds trust and loyalty.

## Challenges in QA for Agile Teams

Agile methodologies like Scrum prioritize rapid development, creating unique QA challenges:

1. **Tight Deadlines**: Testing must happen within short sprint durations.
2. **Changing Requirements**: Evolving criteria makes collaboration crucial.
3. **Continuous Code Updates**: Frequent changes demand rigorous regression testing.
4. **Weaker Resource Availability**: Limited time and workforce strain coverage.
