## Understanding Today’s QA Landscape

Quality assurance has transformed from manual testing to being embedded throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). With agile, DevOps, and CI/CD practices, QA teams must ensure continuous and scalable testing while addressing rapid release cycles and user-centric experiences.

### Key Challenges in Modern QA:
1. **Continuous Testing Across SDLC**: Ensuring seamless testing across CI/CD pipelines.
2. **Scalability and Performance Testing**: Handling complex systems under varying loads.
3. **User-Centric Testing**: Prioritizing usability and accessibility.
4. **Rapid Release Cycles**: Compressed timelines demanding efficient, agile testing.

As technologies advance, these challenges demand innovative solutions.
