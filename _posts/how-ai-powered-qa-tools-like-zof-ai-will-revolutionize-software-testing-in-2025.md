## Current QA Challenges Hindering Progress

Modern software development brings rapid innovation, but QA struggles to keep pace due to various limitations:

1. **Complex Application Architectures**: With APIs, microservices, third-party integrations, and intricate ecosystems, testing becomes increasingly difficult and time-intensive.
2. **Manual Testing Bottlenecks**: Relying on manual testing still dominates QA in many teams, yet it’s error-prone, costly, and slow.
3. **Insufficient Test Coverage**: Traditional testing often misses critical edge cases, leaving systems vulnerable to unforeseen bugs.
4. **Resource Restrictions**: QA teams may lack time, tools, and skilled members, leading to incomplete tests.
5. **Trade-Off Between Speed and Quality**: Under tight deadlines, faster releases come at the expense of quality assurance.

These issues highlight the need for smarter, scalable solutions—and that’s where tools like Zof AI play an essential role.
