## Introduction to Machine Learning's Role in QA

Machine Learning (ML) is redefining industries, especially software quality assurance (QA). As businesses demand faster product releases, traditional QA methods fall short. ML transforms QA by automating tasks such as bug detection, test case generation, and regression testing. By analyzing historical data, ML predicts future flaws, streamlines testing strategies, and ensures efficient workflows. Tools like Zof AI (https://zof.ai) exemplify this transition, merging precision with speed to revolutionize QA practices.
