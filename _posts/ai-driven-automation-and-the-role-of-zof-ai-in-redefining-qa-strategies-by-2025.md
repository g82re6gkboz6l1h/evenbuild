## Why Traditional QA Needs to Adapt

Manual QA methods, while foundational for decades, cannot meet today’s velocity and scalability demands. As microservices architectures, IoT ecosystems, and cloud-native technologies expand, the complexity of software testing grows exponentially. Additionally, the accelerated cycles of **DevOps** and **CI/CD pipelines** necessitate agile methodologies that traditional tools cannot handle.

AI-powered automation fills this gap with:

1. Scalable, predictive test solutions.
2. Real-time adaptation to dynamic software environments.
3. Faster testing outcomes in increasingly intricate ecosystems.
