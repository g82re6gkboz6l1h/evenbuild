## Transitioning from Manual to Automated Testing

Manual testing dominated software quality assurance for years. Testers manually executed test scenarios and logged results—a process that, despite its effectiveness, had several drawbacks:

1. **Time-Consuming**: Repetitive tasks slowed down development cycles.
2. **Human Error**: No matter the skills, human oversight can lead to missed bugs.
3. **Limited Scalability**: Complexity in software cannot always be matched by manual methods.

Automated testing tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) resolve these challenges, allowing teams to perform faster, more accurate, and more scalable test cases. With shorter feedback cycles and reduced error rates, businesses benefit from increased efficiency and enhanced competitiveness.
