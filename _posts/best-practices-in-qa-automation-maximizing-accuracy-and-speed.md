## What is QA Automation?

QA automation uses software tools and scripts to perform tasks traditionally done by manual testing. By automating repetitive and complex test cases, teams can boost efficiency, reduce human errors, and accelerate their release cycles. While manual testing has its place in exploratory and usability assessments, QA automation excels in regression testing, performance analysis, and maintaining consistent results.

Automation is indispensable for DevOps and Agile workflows, enabling faster iterations of high-quality software. Teams can prioritize innovation while ensuring robust test coverage and accuracy, critical for scaling operations efficiently.
