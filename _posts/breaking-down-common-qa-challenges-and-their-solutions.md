## Explore the Top QA Challenges

### 1. Limited Test Coverage
QA teams frequently miss edge cases due to tight deadlines or limited resources, risking bugs in the final product.

### 2. Reliance on Manual Testing
Without automation frameworks, manual testing can hinder productivity, increasing errors as applications grow complex.

### 3. Communication Breakdown
Inefficient collaboration between QA and developers leads to unclear bug reports, redundant fixes, and delays.

### 4. Changing Requirements
Evolving specs make it hard for QAs to design effective, timely test cases, disrupting project timelines.

### 5. Scalability Problems
Testing for scalability—like load handling and multi-platform checks—can overwhelm some QA teams.

### 6. Balancing Speed and Quality
Short development cycles force teams to compromise between fast delivery and meticulous quality checks.
