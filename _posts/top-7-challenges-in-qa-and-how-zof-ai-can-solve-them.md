## Common Challenges in Traditional QA Processes

Before we delve into solutions, let’s explore the most prominent bottlenecks QA teams encounter:

1. **Repetitive Manual Testing**
   QA personnel often conduct repetitive tests manually, consuming time and introducing inconsistencies.
   
2. **Human Errors**
   Even skilled testers can overlook critical flaws, impairing product quality.

3. **Limited Test Coverage**
   Tight deadlines and resource restrictions may lead to incomplete testing, exposing software to risks.

4. **Poor Team Collaboration**
   Siloed operations between developers and testers result in miscommunication and delays.

5. **Lack of Data-Driven Insights**
   Decisions are often made without actionable data, resulting in inefficiencies throughout testing.

6. **Slow Feedback Cycles**
   Bugs detected late in development increase fixing costs and efforts.

7. **Difficulty with Agile Adaption**
   QA struggles to maintain pace with the rapid iterations required by Agile frameworks.
