## Common Challenges of Manual Testing in QA

Despite being integral to software development, manual testing faces several persistent challenges:

1. **Time-Intensive Processes**: Test preparation, execution, and documentation require meticulous effort, causing delays in software delivery, especially for complex applications.

2. **Human Error Risks**: Repetitive tasks in manual testing can lead testers to overlook critical issues, compromising final product quality.

3. **Scalability Issues**: As applications grow in complexity, manual testing demands more resources, making it inefficient for large-scale systems.

4. **Difficulty in Defect Analysis**: Finding and understanding the root cause of defects is time-consuming and poses bottlenecks during troubleshooting.

5. **High Costs**: The reliance on human resources for extensive manual testing makes it expensive—particularly in industries requiring frequent updates.

Modern software development’s fast-paced demands for quality assurance and innovation call for solutions like Zof AI to optimize manual testing processes efficiently.
