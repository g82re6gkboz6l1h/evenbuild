## Why QA Automation is Crucial

### Traditional QA Pitfalls
Manual QA processes often present challenges such as:
- **Time-Intensive**: Too much effort lost to repetitive testing.
- **Error-Prone**: Human mistakes impact accuracy.
- **Scalability Issues**: Limited bandwidth for rapidly expanding test cases.
- **CI/CD Delays**: Slow testing disrupts development pipelines.

### The Case for Automation
Automated QA testing addresses these limitations by offering faster, consistent, and scalable testing. Solutions like Zof AI take automation further through advanced AI features, simplifying QA while maintaining reliability.
