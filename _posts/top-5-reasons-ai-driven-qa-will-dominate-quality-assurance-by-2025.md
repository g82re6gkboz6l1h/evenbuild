## 1. What is AI-driven Quality Assurance?

AI-driven QA utilizes cutting-edge technologies like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to automate testing workflows. These tools don't merely repeat tasks—they adapt, analyze historical data, and predict outcomes with superior accuracy compared to manual methods.

For example, AI automates test script creation, performance monitoring, and regression testing, reducing human error and accelerating development cycles. Companies resisting AI's disruption risk falling behind as the field evolves.
