## Common QA Challenges in Traditional Testing

Traditional QA methods often result in delays, inefficiencies, and errors. Let's look at the frequent obstacles teams face:

1. **Time-Consuming Manual Testing**  
   Manual testing is error-prone and struggles to cope with rapid release cycles, leading to delayed project timelines.

2. **Incomplete Test Coverage**  
   Achieving 100% test coverage is daunting, often resulting in inconsistent testing results.

3. **High Costs of Scaling QA**  
   Expanding QA teams to manage larger projects can significantly increase your costs.

4. **Delayed Bug Identification**  
   Feedback loops for bugs and performance issues are often lengthy, causing project delays.

5. **Fragmented Tools**  
   Integrating multiple disparate tools can create inefficiencies and slow testing processes.

The solution? **AI-driven QA workflows**, like those provided by [Zof AI](https://zof.ai).
