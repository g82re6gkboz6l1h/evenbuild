## What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing involves human testers directly interacting with software applications to identify issues. Common methods include exploratory testing, usability testing, and black-box testing, where testers simulate user behavior to assess system functionality.

### Characteristics of Manual Testing:
- Requires human expertise and intuition.
- Ideal for dynamic, unscripted test scenarios.
- Time-consuming for repetitive cases.
- Prone to inconsistencies and human error.

---
What is Automated Testing?
Automated testing uses tools or scripts to execute predefined test cases, particularly suited for performance, load, and regression testing.

### Characteristics of Automated Testing:
- Involves script or tool-based execution.
- Efficient for repetitive and large-scale testing.
- Reduces human error and ensures precise outcomes.
- Requires significant initial investment and ongoing maintenance.

Advantages and Challenges of Both Testing Types

### Manual Testing Advantages:
1. Human judgment identifies subtle UX/UI issues.
2. Effective for exploratory, non-scripted scenarios.
3. Requires minimal upfront investment.

### Manual Testing Challenges:
1. Not scalable for large projects.
2. Subjective outcomes due to human judgment.
3. Slower and error-prone for repetitive tasks.

### Automated Testing Advantages:
1. Fast and highly scalable.
2. Reduces variability and human error.
3. Cost-effective over time for iterative testing.

### Automated Testing Challenges:
1. High initial setup and training costs.
2. Limited for dynamic, exploratory testing.
3. Requires regular updates to maintain scripts.
