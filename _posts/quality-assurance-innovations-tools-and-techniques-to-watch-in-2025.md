## The Evolution of QA Tools

Over the decades, QA has transformed from manual, error-prone processes into automated solutions. Here’s a brief journey:

### From Manual to Automation
- **Manual Testing**: Relied on meticulous human effort, was time-consuming, and prone to error.
- **Automation Tools**: Selenium revolutionized QA in the 2000s by improving speed and accuracy while reducing repetition.
- **Integration with Agile & DevOps**: Testing merged with continuous development (CI/CD pipelines), enabling real-time validation.

### QA in 2025 with Generative AI
The leap into AI-powered QA tools, like **Zof AI** ([https://zof.ai](https://zof.ai)), is transforming the industry. These tools use AI and machine learning (ML) to predict bugs, prevent errors, and sustain script integrity in fast-changing software environments.
