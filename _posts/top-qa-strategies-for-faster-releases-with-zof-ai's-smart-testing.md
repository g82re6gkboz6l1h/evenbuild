## Overcoming QA Challenges in Modern Development

Software teams face persistent QA challenges that impede efficiency:

- **Disconnect Between Teams:** Siloed roles create bottlenecks in communication among developers, testers, and operations.
- **Time-Consuming Manual Testing:** Outdated manual methods are prone to delays and errors.
- **Late Bug Detection:** Issues found late in development prolong fixes and delay delivery.
- **Scalability Barriers:** Traditional QA struggles to address the increasing complexity and volume of modern apps.
- **Limited Predictive Capabilities:** Teams often lack proactive tools to identify failure points early.

Modern solutions, like Zof AI’s intelligent testing platform, are essential for addressing these challenges efficiently.
