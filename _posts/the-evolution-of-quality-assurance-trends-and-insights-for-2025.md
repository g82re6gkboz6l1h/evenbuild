## Emerging Software Testing Methodologies  

By 2025, cutting-edge methodologies will dominate the QA landscape:

### 1. Shift-Left and Shift-Right Testing  
Engage QA teams early (Shift-Left) to prevent defects and streamline costs while ensuring performance in real-world environments post-deployment (Shift-Right).

### 2. Exploratory Testing  
Explore software dynamically and intuitively to uncover edge cases that may not be addressed by automated systems.

### 3. Continuous Testing  
Integrating testing in CI/CD pipelines allows real-time validation of code changes for faster, quality-driven product delivery.
