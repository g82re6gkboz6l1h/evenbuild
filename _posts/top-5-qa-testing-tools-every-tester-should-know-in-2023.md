## Manual vs. Automated Testing: Key Comparisons

Each testing approach has unique strengths. Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature                 | Manual Testing                        | Automated Testing                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Efficiency**          | Time-intensive                      | Highly efficient for repetitive tasks |
| **Costs**               | Lower upfront but labor-intensive    | Higher upfront, saves long-term costs |
| **Human Error**         | Susceptible to errors                | Reduces error significantly           |
| **Complex Scenarios**   | Ideal for exploratory testing        | Superior for multi-layered scenarios  |
| **Scalability**         | Limited scalability                  | Easily scalable across large projects |

Tools like **Zof AI** elevate automated testing, combining efficiency with AI-driven precision. Manual testing remains vital for user-focused design evaluation, but automation ensures scalability for complex systems.
