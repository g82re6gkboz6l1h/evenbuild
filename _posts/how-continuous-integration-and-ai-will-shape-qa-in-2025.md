## The Power of CI/CD and AI in QA

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) streamline automated testing and release workflows. CI enables frequent merging and testing of code changes, while CD ensures validated builds are deployed seamlessly. However, the growing complexity of modern software calls for smarter tools—enter AI. By 2025, AI-powered platforms will be an essential component, automating real-time assessments, detecting faults, and optimizing resources.
