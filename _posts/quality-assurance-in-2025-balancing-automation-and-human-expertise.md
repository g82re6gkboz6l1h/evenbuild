## The Strategic Role of Manual Testing in the Age of AI

AI automation handles repetitive tasks such as regression testing and performance validation, yet manual testing thrives in areas demanding creativity and empathy. Manual testers now function as quality analysts, focusing on exploratory testing, usability, and assessing edge cases. Their expertise ensures that QA processes remain adaptive, inclusive, and able to account for complex real-world scenarios.
