## Common QA Challenges in the AI Era

### 1. **Unpredictable AI Behaviors**
AI applications often produce non-deterministic outputs, requiring QA teams to rethink their traditional testing approaches.

### 2. **Bias Management**
Bias in AI models can cause unethical results. QA now extends to ensuring fairness and eliminating discriminatory outcomes.

### 3. **Handling Dynamic Data**
AI operates on real-time data streams, introducing complex dependencies and output variability, making reliable testing more difficult.

### 4. **Model Validation**
Testing accuracy, edge cases, and outliers demand broader data validation frameworks.

### 5. **Ensuring Scalability**
Testing for robust performance under high data loads requires specialized tools for large-scale systems.
