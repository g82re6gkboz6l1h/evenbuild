## Common QA Workflow Challenges and Their Impact

Despite its importance in the software development lifecycle, QA workflows are often riddled with challenges like:

### 1. **Time-Intensive Manual Testing**
Manual testing delays delivery timelines and increases fatigue for testers working on repetitive tasks, such as bug detection and cross-environment compatibility testing.

### 2. **Limited Automation Coverage**
Existing tools often lack the flexibility or capacity to provide comprehensive automation coverage, leaving critical gaps in testing that jeopardize product quality.

### 3. **High Costs of Testing Resources**
Manual testing and traditional automation can be resource-heavy, requiring significant investment in skilled testers, tools, and infrastructure.

### 4. **Data Silos and Fragmentation**
QA insights are often scattered across multiple tools and platforms, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for optimization.

### 5. **Scalability Issues**
As organizations scale, existing QA processes may struggle to accommodate growing workloads, resulting in slower development cycles and reduced efficiency.
