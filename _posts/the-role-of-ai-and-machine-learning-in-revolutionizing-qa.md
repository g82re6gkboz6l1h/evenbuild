## How AI is Transforming QA Workflows

Traditional QA processes rely heavily on manual testing or partially automated methods, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. AI introduces a paradigm shift, leveraging intelligent systems to streamline test creation, optimize workflows, and improve analysis speed.

For example, AI-driven tools analyze extensive codebases, detect anomalies, and provide remediation suggestions to developers. They enable smarter test prioritization, giving QA teams the ability to focus on critical areas efficiently, thus minimizing resource wastage and delays.
