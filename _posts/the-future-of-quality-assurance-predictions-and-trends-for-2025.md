## QA Evolution: From Waterfall to Agile to DevOps

QA has come a long way since the days of manual, waterfall-driven testing. Agile development integrated QA as a crucial part of iterative workflows, prioritizing collaboration and early defect detection. Today’s DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines emphasize continuous testing, blending QA seamlessly into every phase of development. 

As we approach 2025, these paradigms are further enhanced by AI, machine learning, and advanced testing platforms, making QA more dynamic and predictive.
