## How QA Has Evolved Over the Years

Traditionally, QA was seen as a manual and isolated phase of software development. But this has shifted significantly in recent years to embrace automation and collaboration, making QA faster and more accurate. 

Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud platforms, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines have transformed the process. AI is particularly noteworthy, with tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) streamlining test execution and identifying system anomalies. Today, QA is no longer just about finding bugs; it’s about ensuring end-to-end quality and value delivery across the entire development lifecycle.
