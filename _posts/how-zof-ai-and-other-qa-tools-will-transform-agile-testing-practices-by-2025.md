## What is Agile Testing?

Agile testing complements Agile development's principles by focusing on early, frequent, and iterative testing. Key features include:

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Agile testing is embedded into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.
2. **Collaboration across teams**: Facilitating synergy between testers, developers, and stakeholders.
3. **Early defect detection**: Identifying and fixing issues earlier in the software lifecycle.
4. **Automation-first methodology**: Agile encourages automation for repetitive tasks.

Nevertheless, manual testing and increasing software complexity challenge Agile workflows. Enter AI-powered tools like Zof AI to handle these hurdles efficiently.
