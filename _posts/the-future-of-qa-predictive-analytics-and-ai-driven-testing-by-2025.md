## What is Predictive Analytics in QA?

Predictive analytics leverages historical data, machine learning, and statistical models to forecast potential risks before they occur. For QA teams, this proactive approach transforms testing into a data-driven process, identifying high-risk areas in applications before testing even begins. By analyzing bug patterns, crash trends, and code quality metrics, predictive analytics focuses testing efforts where they matter most.

### Benefits of Predictive Analytics in QA

1. **Early Risk Detection**: Identify problem areas earlier in development cycles.
2. **Targeted Testing**: Prioritize high-risk features, saving time and effort.
3. **Efficient Resources**: Streamline workflows by addressing critical concerns first.
