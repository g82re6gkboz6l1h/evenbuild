## Why AI Is the Future of QA

Traditional QA relies heavily on time-intensive manual testing and semi-automated scripts, making it difficult to scale in fast-paced development cycles. AI introduces intelligent automation, analyzing data and adapting dynamically to optimize the testing process. Unlike conventional methods, AI functions autonomously to create, prioritize, and execute test cases while predicting potential defects and vulnerabilities in code.

By 2025, industries predict widespread adoption of AI in QA, bolstered by AI-powered tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai). These platforms simplify complex testing workflows, offering unprecedented agility and reliability without the associated manual workload.
