## Introduction to AI in QA

QA is critical to ensuring high-performing software products. Traditional methods—manual testing and scripted automation—are falling short in the face of increasing software complexity and demand for rapid delivery. AI, leveraging machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and predictive analytics, introduces real-time analysis and decision-making to QA processes, enhancing speed and accuracy.

Zof AI, an innovator in this space, uses intelligent automation to anticipate software issues, minimize human dependency, and deliver defect-proof testing systems, enabling teams to stay ahead in 2025's tech-driven landscape.
