## Top 10 QA Practices for Superior Software Quality

**1. Start Testing Early:** Detect bugs in the initial development phases to prevent escalated costs. 

**2. Define Clear Requirements:** Collaborate with stakeholders to eliminate ambiguity in project goals.

**3. Automate Testing:** Use tools like Selenium or [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) to streamline repetitive tasks like regression testing.

**4. Continuous Testing:** Integrate manual and automated tests throughout the development pipeline.

**5. Utilize AI Tools:** Leverage AI technologies for predictive analytics, automated test creation, and risk assessments. [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) can revolutionize your QA efforts.

**6. Risk-Based Testing:** Allocate focusing efforts on high-impact application areas, such as user-facing modules.

**7. Compatibility Testing:** Ensure cross-browser/device functionality to optimize the user experience.

**8. Track QA Metrics:** Monitor defect density, mean time to detect and repair, and customer-reported bugs for ongoing improvement.

**9. Foster QA and Developer Collaboration:** Practices like Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) align both teams toward shared objectives.

**10. Iterate and Improve:** Implement a feedback loop and consistently refine processes.
