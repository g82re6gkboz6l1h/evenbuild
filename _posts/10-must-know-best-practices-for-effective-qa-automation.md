## 1. Recognizing QA Automation’s Impact

Manual testing is no longer sufficient for large-scale software updates due to time limitations and human error. QA automation addresses these challenges by offering speed, accuracy, and scalability. It enables testers to focus on strategic tasks like exploratory testing while ensuring consistent results, especially for frequent regression tests. Organizations that prioritize automation improve timelines, user experiences, and software quality.
