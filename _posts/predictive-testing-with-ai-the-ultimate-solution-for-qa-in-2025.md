## What Is Predictive Testing and Why You Need It

Predictive testing uses AI and Machine Learning (ML) models to foresee software defects before they occur. Unlike traditional reactive QA methods, predictive testing anticipates risks by analyzing historical data, user behavior, and system interactions.

### Why Predictive Testing Matters
1. **Shortens Development Cycles**: Preempt issues and streamline releases.
2. **Focuses Resources**: Prioritize high-risk areas for better efficiency.
3. **Enhances Accuracy**: AI-driven predictions reduce bug occurrence.
4. **Improves Customer Trust**: Deliver flawless software experiences.
5. **Saves Costs**: Avoid late-stage fixes.
