## Manual vs. Automated Testing: Key Methodologies Explained

Testing ensures flawless software functionality. Choosing manual or automated testing depends on project scope and requirements:

### Manual Testing
Manual QA involves hands-on scenario testing without scripts or tools. This intuitive approach highlights user behavior and usability.

#### Key Benefits:
- Human-centric usability assessment.
- Flexible exploratory testing.
- Minimal preparation—ideal for quick fixes.

### Automated Testing
Automated QA uses tools to execute pre-set test cases, ensuring rapid, consistent coverage for complex projects.

#### Key Benefits:
- Speeds up repetitive task execution.
- Eliminates human-error risks.
- Efficiently scales to enterprise-level projects.

Tools like Selenium, JUnit, and [Zof AI](https://zof.ai?src=evenbuild.vercel.app) simplify automation using artificial intelligence.
