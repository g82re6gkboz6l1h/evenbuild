## What is Predictive Artificial Intelligence in QA?

Predictive AI in QA is a transformative methodology leveraging advanced machine learning and historical data to preemptively identify software defects and vulnerabilities. Instead of traditional reactive testing, predictive AI analyzes patterns from test cases, user behavior, and code changes to forecast areas of concern. This shift to proactive QA ensures better forecasting of software risks, enabling cost and resource optimization.

By 2025, predictive AI will bridge the gap between development and testing, allowing QA teams to focus on innovation instead of repetitive testing.
