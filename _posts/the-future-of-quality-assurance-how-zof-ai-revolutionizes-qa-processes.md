## Challenges of Traditional Quality Assurance

While integral to maintaining high standards, traditional QA processes face significant obstacles, including:

1. **Manual Effort and Errors**  
   Relying heavily on manual inspections and tests increases the likelihood of human errors.

2. **Time and Resource Intensive**  
   Conventional methods demand excessive labor and extended timelines, delaying market launches.

3. **Poor Scalability**  
   Manual QA processes falter under the pressure of scaling businesses requiring larger volumes of testing.

4. **Inconsistent Quality Benchmarks**  
   Variable levels of expertise among testers lead to inconsistent outcomes across projects.

5. **Complexity and Increasing Workload**  
   As technology evolves, QA becomes harder to manage using traditional tools or human-only approaches.
