## Emerging Trends Redefining QA

Traditionally, QA centered around defect detection and ensuring reliability, but today it encompasses the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). With the rise of agile practices and DevOps, QA now integrates seamlessly into every phase of development.

By 2025, expect QA to focus heavily on user-centric testing, continuous testing, and mobile-first strategies. User experience (UX)-driven testing and globalized application testing will be critical as more businesses target remote users and diverse markets. QA is no longer a backstage role; it's a game-changer for delivering exceptional products and customer satisfaction.
