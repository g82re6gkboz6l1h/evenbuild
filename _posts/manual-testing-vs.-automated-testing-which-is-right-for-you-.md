## Manual Testing vs. Automated Testing Defined

### Manual Testing
Manual testing involves hands-on execution of test cases. Testers simulate user behavior to identify bugs, explore workflows, and assess usability—perfect for tasks demanding creativity and adaptability.

### Automated Testing
Automated testing leverages software tools and scripts to execute predefined test cases efficiently. Ideal for repetitive checks, scalability, and faster testing cycles.
