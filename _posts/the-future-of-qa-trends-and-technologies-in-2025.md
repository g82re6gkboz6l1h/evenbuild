## Introduction: QA’s Transformative Journey Towards 2025

The traditional QA approach mainly revolves around manual testing and structured workflows, but modern software delivery demands heightened efficiency and scalability. By 2025, QA will transcend its conventional practices, embedding itself deeply into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) with technologies like predictive AI and automated testing frameworks.

### Key Developments in QA:
1. **Continuous Testing:** Positioned within CI/CD pipelines, this real-time testing technique ensures ongoing identification and resolution of defects.
2. **Shift-Left Testing:** A proactive early-phase testing strategy designed to identify issues during requirements gathering, coding, and design.

To keep pace, organizations must integrate tools and processes that foster refinement, collaboration, and precision, with emerging technologies taking center stage.
