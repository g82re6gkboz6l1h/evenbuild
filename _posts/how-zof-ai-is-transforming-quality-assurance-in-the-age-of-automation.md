## The Role of Artificial Intelligence in QA Enhancement

Traditional QA relied on manual testing for addressing functionality, regression, and performance validation. These methods were often time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. The integration of **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) in QA has addressed these shortcomings, offering automation, improved accuracy, and scalability that manual techniques lack.

By leveraging AI, QA systems can simulate user behavior, process massive datasets, and pinpoint issues often overlooked by manual testers. Machine learning in particular allows continuous improvement of the QA process, enabling more proactive testing solutions.

**Zof AI**, one of the leading AI-powered QA platforms, takes these capabilities further by combining advanced automation with adaptive learning to meet modern-day QA challenges effectively.
