## Challenges With Traditional QA Automation

### Lack of Flexibility
Older automation tools depend on static scripts that require constant updates when software changes—time-consuming and prone to errors.

### High Maintenance Costs
Legacy tools demand frequent script maintenance for updates, slowing production and increasing costs.

### Limited Context-Awareness
Traditional systems miss edge cases and subtle errors due to their rigid "pass/fail" frameworks.

### Scalability Issues
With agile workflows demanding rapid deployments, older QA tools struggle to cover diverse test cases across devices and platforms.
