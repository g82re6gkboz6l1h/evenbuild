## Why QA Strategy is Essential

Launching a product without a proper QA strategy can lead to poor performance, compatibility issues, and bad reviews, costing you customers and credibility. Here’s why QA strategy should be a priority:

1. **Enhances Customer Experience**: Deliver products that meet and exceed user expectations to bolster loyalty and satisfaction.
2. **Saves Costs**: Fixing bugs in development is cheaper than after launch, safeguarding your budget and reputation.
3. **Ensures Compliance**: Particularly in regulated industries, QA ensures your product meets required standards.
4. **Gains Competitive Advantage**: A superior, bug-free product sets you apart from competitors.
