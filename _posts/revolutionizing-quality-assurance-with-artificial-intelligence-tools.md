## Introduction to AI in QA

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly revolutionizing industries worldwide, and QA is no exception. The traditional QA process—with manual testing and troubleshooting—was time-intensive, prone to human error, and lacked scalability. The advent of AI introduces machine learning, automation, and advanced analytics into testing frameworks. These tools self-learn from historical data to identify patterns, anticipate issues, and adapt swiftly to complex scenarios, ultimately driving superior results.
