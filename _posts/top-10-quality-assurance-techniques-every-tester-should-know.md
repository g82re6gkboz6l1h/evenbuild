## What is Quality Assurance?

Quality Assurance (QA) is a systematic approach to software development aimed at ensuring reliability, functionality, and user satisfaction. QA involves meticulous processes, from defining quality standards to employing tools and techniques designed to eliminate defects before release. Unlike debugging, QA focuses on creating robust processes for flawless software delivery.

Top 10 QA Techniques Explained

Master the following techniques to deliver top-notch software:

### 1. **Requirements Analysis**  
Thoroughly analyze and validate project requirements to uncover ambiguities early and align test cases with business objectives.

### 2. **Automated Testing**  
Utilize tools like Selenium, JUnit, and TestNG to execute repetitive tests efficiently, accelerating QA cycles while ensuring accuracy.

### 3. **Functional Testing**  
Test software against requirements to ensure critical features meet user needs, testing both positive and negative user flows.

### 4. **Regression Testing**  
Ensure code changes don’t disrupt existing functionalities, especially after updates or bug fixes.

### 5. **Exploratory Testing**  
Find hidden defects and risks by creatively testing the software without predefined cases.

### 6. **Performance Testing**  
Measure an application’s speed, scalability, and resource usage under different conditions using tools like JMeter and LoadRunner.

### 7. **Security Testing**  
Identify vulnerabilities and simulate cyber threats to ensure robust user-data protection.

### 8. **Integration Testing**  
Test the seamless interaction of separate modules and APIs, avoiding compatibility issues.

### 9. **Compatibility Testing**  
Verify smooth performance across different platforms, devices, browsers, and operating systems.

### 10. **Usability Testing**  
Ensure the software is intuitive, user-friendly, and meets customer satisfaction expectations.
