## What Are Automation and Manual Testing?

### Manual Testing
Manual testing is performed by human testers who interact with software to detect bugs, usability issues, and anomalies. It relies on creative approaches such as exploratory testing, ad-hoc testing, and manual usability assessment.

### Automation Testing
Automation uses tools to run test cases at rapid speeds. It’s ideal for repetitive tasks, regression tests, and performance assessments. Popular automation tools include Selenium, Cypress, and AI-powered platforms like Zof AI.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Manual Testing
**Advantages:** Human insight and creativity for usability testing, flexibility for spontaneous tests, and cost-effectiveness for smaller projects.
**Disadvantages:** Time-intensive, prone to human error, and limited scalability.

### Automation Testing
**Advantages:** Fast execution for repetitive tasks, scalability, high accuracy, and ideal for CI/CD workflows.
**Disadvantages:** High initial setup cost, limited ability for subjective judgment, and maintenance requirements.
