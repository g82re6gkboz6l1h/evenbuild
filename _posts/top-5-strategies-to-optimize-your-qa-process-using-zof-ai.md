## Why Optimized QA Makes a Difference

Software testing goes beyond bug-finding—it ensures seamless software functionality under real-world conditions. Subpar QA can result in:

- **Delays:** Prolonged testing cycles stemming from missed issues.
- **Costs:** Inefficient manual testing wastes resources.
- **Compromised Quality:** Undetected bugs harm user experience.

With tools like **Zof AI**, your QA processes can evolve for smarter testing, faster delivery, and better collaboration.
