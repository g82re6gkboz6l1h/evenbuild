## Why a Mix of Manual and Automated Testing is Vital

Both manual and automated testing contribute unique strengths to a QA strategy, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

### What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing is performed by testers evaluating software functionality and usability. It helps find edge cases and provides valuable insights into user experience.

### Key Benefits of Automated Testing
Automated testing leverages tools to perform large-scale and repetitive test cases efficiently, ensuring speed, accuracy, and scalability. Together, these testing methodologies achieve holistic QA results.
