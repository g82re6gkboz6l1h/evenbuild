## Understanding Intelligent Automation in QA

Intelligent automation integrates artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data analytics with automation techniques for smarter testing solutions. Unlike conventional test scripts, this technology adapts dynamically to various test scenarios.

### Key Features:
1. **AI-Driven Decision Making**: Automated prioritization of risk areas and detection of hidden patterns.
2. **Self-Healing Test Scripts**: AI-enabled scripts recover from code changes without manual interventions.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Anticipates high-risk defects based on historical data.
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Simplifies test script creation using natural language.
5. **Continuous Testing**: Promotes seamless integration and delivery cycles with real-time feedback.
