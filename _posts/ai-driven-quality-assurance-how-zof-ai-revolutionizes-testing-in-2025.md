## What is AI-Driven Quality Assurance?

AI-driven quality assurance leverages technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and automation to optimize QA in software development. Unlike traditional manual testing methods, which are labor-intensive and error-prone, AI-driven QA automates repetitive tasks, predicts potential flaws, and adapts testing for scalability.

Tools like Zof AI empower QA teams to move beyond reactive approaches to testing. They automate workflows, analyze patterns in past data, and deliver actionable insights, ensuring faster delivery of more reliable software. As QA processes evolve to meet the demands of modern development cycles, adopting AI is no longer optional but essential.
