## What is AI-Driven QA?

Artificial Intelligence in QA leverages advanced technologies like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive modeling to optimize and automate testing processes. Unlike traditional manual testing or scripted automation, AI-powered systems analyze vast datasets, learn from historical software and user patterns, and adapt dynamically. This ensures precise test coverage, quick bug identification, and smarter solutions.
