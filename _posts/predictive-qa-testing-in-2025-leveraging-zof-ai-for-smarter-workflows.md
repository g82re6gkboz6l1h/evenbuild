## What is Predictive Testing in QA?

Predictive testing involves the use of advanced AI, machine learning, and data analytics to predict potential vulnerabilities and system failures. In contrast to traditional reactive QA processes, this approach emphasizes proactive risk management, analyzing behavioral and system patterns to address problem areas before they become critical. 

In software's high-speed, complex landscape, predictive QA testing is quickly becoming a necessity for achieving reliability, efficiency, and seamless integrations across platforms.
