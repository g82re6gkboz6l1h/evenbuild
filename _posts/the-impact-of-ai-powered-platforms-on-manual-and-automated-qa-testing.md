## Manual vs Automated QA Testing: A Brief Summary

### Manual QA Testing
Manual testing relies on human testers to evaluate software intuitively for aspects like UI, UX, and visually intricate workflows. Ideal for exploratory and creative testing, manual testing is robust yet time-intensive, error-prone, and less scalable.

### Automated QA Testing
Automated testing employs scripts to run pre-defined test cases swiftly, optimizing repetitive tasks and regression testing. Yet, automation struggles with dynamic scenarios and comes with tedious script maintenance.

## Transformative Role of AI in QA Testing

### Enhancements to Manual QA
AI automates repetitive duties so testers focus on strategic exploration. It swiftly analyzes data for error patterns, predicts high-risk areas, and delivers actionable insights. AI tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) empower testers with performance-based, risk-prioritized guidance.

### Benefits for Automated QA
AI-powered automation transcends static test scripts. Platforms dynamically adjust tests via real-time data and application updates. AI enhances coverage, spots script gaps, and optimizes execution routes, while self-healing technology autonomously updates scripts post-application changes.
