## Overcoming Challenges in Traditional QA Practices

Though essential, traditional automated QA faces various obstacles, including:

1. **Setup Costs**: High investments needed for initial framework configuration and constant script maintenance.
2. **Static Scripts**: Rigid test scripts frequently break against minor updates.
3. **Expert Barrier**: Requires coding knowledge, limiting accessibility for smaller teams.
4. **Scalability Struggles**: Dynamic ecosystems amplify fragility in testing scenarios.
5. **Coverage vs. Quality**: Automation often prioritizes broad coverage while neglecting meticulous real-world testing.

Addressing these limitations, Zof AI acts as a beacon of transformation combining intelligent design and adaptive systems.
