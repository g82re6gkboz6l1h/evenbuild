## What is Manual Testing vs Automated Testing?

When developing any software system, teams often face a crucial decision—should they prioritize manual testing or automated testing? Knowing the differences and specifics can help make informed decisions.

### **Manual Testing:**
Manual testing involves testers operating applications manually to detect defects, improve usability, and ensure functionality. It is particularly effective for exploratory testing or dynamic applications. 

#### Key Benefits:
- Human creativity for edge cases and complex scenarios.
- Real-world usability insights.
- Cost-effective for small projects.

#### Key Challenges:
- Time-consuming.
- Error-prone for repetitive tasks.
- Limited scalability.

---

### **Automated Testing:**
Automated testing uses software tools to perform repetitive tests for accuracy and reliability. It excels at validating actions repeatedly and efficiently.

#### Key Benefits:
- Scales for large, complex systems.
- Consistent outcomes without human bias.
- Fast validation for high-volume processes.

#### Key Challenges:
- Requires initial setup and expertise.
- Limited capability for exploratory scenarios.
- Maintenance-intensive scripting.
