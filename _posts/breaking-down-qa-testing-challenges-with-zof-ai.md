## Common Hurdles in QA Testing

QA teams encounter challenges impacting speed, accuracy, and scalability:

### 1. **Time Constraints**
Short sprints allow limited time for exhaustive manual testing.

### 2. **Complex Ecosystems**
Microservices, APIs, external integrations complicate test coverage.

### 3. **Resource Shortages**
Small QA teams struggle handling big workloads while navigating new tools.

### 4. **Test Data Accuracy**
Subpar datasets lead to reduced scenario credibility and bug detection.

### 5. **Human Errors**
Manual efforts fail to catch missed checks, inconsistent results, or vulnerabilities.

### 6. **Scalability Gaps**
Traditional tools falter in scaling QA processes to higher traffic volumes.

Here’s how Zof AI transforms these hurdles into growth opportunities.
