## Machine Learning in QA: An Overview

Machine learning, a subset of AI, analyzes historical data to enhance software testing with precision and adaptability. Traditional QA, reliant on manual testing and automations, often falls short when faced with complex, scalable software systems.

ML-driven QA eliminates guesswork by:
- Predicting software vulnerabilities through learning from defect patterns.
- Automatically prioritizing test cases.
- Generating dynamic testing scripts for agile workflows.

With rising demand for agile and DevOps workflows, ML’s integration into QA by 2025 is inevitable, offering remarkable efficiency and performance.
