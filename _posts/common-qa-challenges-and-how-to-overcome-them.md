## Common Challenges in QA Processes

QA processes often encounter recurring obstacles, impeding efficiency and effectiveness.

### 1. **Limited Test Coverage**
Incomplete testing due to time constraints or outdated methodologies often results in bugs disrupting user experience.

### 2. **Cross-Team Collaboration Breakdown**
Lack of synergy between developers and QA teams creates miscommunication and unresolved defects.

### 3. **Manual Testing Drawbacks**
Manual testing is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unscalable, especially in complex applications.

### 4. **Performance and Scalability Testing Neglect**
Underestimating performance testing can lead to downtime when traffic spikes.

### 5. **Mismanaged Testing Data**
Incomplete or incorrect test data hampers accurate evaluations, leading to fragmented outcomes.
