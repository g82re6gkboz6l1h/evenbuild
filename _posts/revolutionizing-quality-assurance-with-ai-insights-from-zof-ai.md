## Why AI Matters in Quality Assurance

AI technology, through Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and predictive analytics, transforms QA processes by improving efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. Traditionally, QA relied on human testers to simulate user interactions and find bugs—a process prone to errors and inefficiencies. Zof AI introduces automated tools that eliminate manual redundancies, predict potential issues, and adapt dynamically to evolving requirements.
