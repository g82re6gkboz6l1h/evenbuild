## Top Challenges Impacting QA in Software Development

Navigating complexities in modern QA environments requires a clear focus on critical challenges:

### Increased Software Complexity
Products increasingly involve integrations with IoT devices, APIs, and cloud services. QA must verify interconnected systems to ensure reliability despite updates or replacements.

### Agile & DevOps Methodologies
Faster development cycles make it difficult for QA teams to maintain quality while testing continuously in Agile and DevOps workflows.

### Testing AI-Powered Software
AI software’s dynamic behavior demands rigorous testing for performance, fairness, and accuracy. QA teams now handle unpredictable machine learning algorithm outputs.

### Limited QA Talent
The interdisciplinary demands of QA—cybersecurity, coding, data analytics—outstrip the availability of skilled professionals, highlighting the need for intelligent tools.
