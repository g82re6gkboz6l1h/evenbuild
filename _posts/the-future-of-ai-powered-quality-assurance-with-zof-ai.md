## Why AI is Transforming QA Practices

Traditional software QA methods rely heavily on manual testing and static automated scripts, making them prone to limitations such as scalability, inefficiency, and human error. Modern applications demand a faster, smarter, and more dynamic testing process. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** transforms QA by enabling real-time insights, adaptive learning, and predictable execution.

Leveraging the power of AI, QA teams can transition from repetitive manual testing to data-driven, automated methodologies. Zof AI leads this transformation with cutting-edge solutions tailored to address the most critical challenges faced by modern QA teams.
