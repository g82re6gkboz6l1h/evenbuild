## AI’s Role in Transforming QA
AI is revolutionizing Quality Assurance by boosting efficiency and accuracy. Traditional QA relies on manual testing or scripted automation but faces core challenges:

1. **Time inefficiencies** – Manual testing involves repetitive tasks that delay software releases.
2. **Human errors** – Testers may overlook edge cases or mislabel defects.
3. **Scalability problems** – Handling large-scale systems with traditional QA tools becomes unmanageable.

AI addresses these limitations through machine learning, predictive analytics, and data-driven algorithms. AI-enabled QA tools enhance defect detection, recognize patterns across intricate environments, and perform quality checks swiftly at scale.
