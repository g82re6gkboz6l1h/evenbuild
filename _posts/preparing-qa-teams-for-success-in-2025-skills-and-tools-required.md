## Transforming QA Roles by 2025

2025 will bring significant shifts in QA roles with greater integration into agile and DevOps workflows.

1. **Automation-First Processes**: Manual testing will take a backseat to automation. QA professionals will need to design and manage testing frameworks to handle automated processes effectively.
   
2. **Shift-Left Testing**: Testing will now start earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), addressing defects during the planning and design phases.

3. **Rise of Quality Engineering**: QA experts are transitioning to quality engineers (QE), ensuring quality integration across every phase of development.

4. **Adoption of AI & ML**: Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are harnessing AI and ML for smarter, faster testing that requires minimal human intervention.

5. **Multidimensional Testing Expansion**: QA will expand beyond functionality, encompassing security, scalability, and sustainability testing to deliver holistic value.
