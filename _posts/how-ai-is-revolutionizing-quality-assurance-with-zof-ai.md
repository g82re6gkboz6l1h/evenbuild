## The Role of AI in QA 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing quality assurance by leveraging machine learning and intelligent algorithms to automate and enhance testing. Traditionally, QA relied on manual testing—a time-intensive process fraught with delays or human error. Automation has improved these processes, yet it still demands significant human intervention. AI, on the other hand, autonomously learns and adapts to perform highly effective testing tasks with minimal oversight.

Platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) provide cutting-edge AI-driven technologies to optimize QA efforts, offering precision, efficiency, cost savings, and scalability unmatched by traditional methods.
