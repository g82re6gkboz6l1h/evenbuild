## What Is Adaptive Testing in QA?

Adaptive testing dynamically evolves test plans based on real-time data and requirements. Unlike static testing, it uses AI-driven insights to boost accuracy and agility. Key benefits include:

1. **Dynamic Test Adjustments:** Tailor test behavior based on app or user changes.
2. **Prioritized Coverage:** Focus on crucial areas for defect identification.
3. **Faster Feedback:** Enable quicker detection and resolution of issues.
