## Identifying Common QA Challenges in Modern Development
Modern software development complicates QA with challenges such as:

### 1. **Increasing Complexity of Software Systems**
Applications combine microservices, APIs, and third-party integrations, requiring robust test coverage.

### 2. **Shorter Development Cycles**
Agile and DevOps demand rapid delivery, putting QA teams under extreme time pressure.

### 3. **Test Coverage Gaps**
Achieving full test coverage is difficult, often resulting in missed critical use cases.

### 4. **Manual Testing Bottlenecks**
Redundant manual tasks slow processes and introduce increased risks of human error.

### 5. **Difficulty Identifying Bugs**
Tracing bugs within complex systems delays resolutions and builds technical debt.

### 6. **Team Collaboration Challenges**
Siloed information hampers smooth collaboration between QA teams and developers.

### 7. **Volume of Data to Analyze**
Analyzing large datasets manually for testing insights is impractical and inefficient.

These challenges highlight the need for smarter, AI-driven solutions to streamline QA processes.
