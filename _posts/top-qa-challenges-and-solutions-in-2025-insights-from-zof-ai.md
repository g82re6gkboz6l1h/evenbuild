## Top QA Challenges in 2025

### 1. Managing Testing Complexity
Applications designed with microservices and cloud-native frameworks are more complex than ever. Testing coverage for distributed and interdependent systems demands comprehensive strategies that are often beyond traditional tools.

### 2. Scalability Limitations
Modern systems need to cope with millions of simultaneous users, highlighting the need to test for performance under varied and extreme conditions.

### 3. Evolving Security Threats
As cyberattacks become AI-driven, traditional security testing fails to address all vulnerabilities, increasing risk exposure.

### 4. DevOps and Continuous Testing Integration
Continuous testing is vital for a fast-paced DevOps environment, yet ensuring precision in QA while keeping up with rapid development cycles is a challenge.
