## What is AI-Driven Quality Assurance?

AI-driven quality assurance employs artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to optimize software testing processes, drastically improving reliability and speed. Rather than relying on manual testing or static rules, these systems use predictive analytics, pattern recognition, and intelligent algorithms to detect defects, optimize test coverage, and streamline workflows.

The strength of AI in QA lies in its ability to emulate user behavior, identify anomalies, and learn from historical data—pushing beyond the constraints of manual testing. By 2025, adopting AI-led QA will not only reduce costs but also set the benchmark for testing velocity and accuracy.
