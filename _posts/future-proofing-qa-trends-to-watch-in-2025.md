## Adapting to Evolving QA Methodologies

Historically, QA has relied on manual and scripted automation testing. However, the rising complexity of applications calls for agile, adaptive, and collaborative QA frameworks. With the adoption of DevOps and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), QA is now an essential, integrated part of the software development lifecycle. 

By 2025, QA professionals will lean on modular testing frameworks, like composable tests, alongside AI-infused automation tools to mitigate errors and streamline workflows. These approaches promise earlier bug detection, reduced redundancy, and faster delivery. Staying agile will be essential for addressing emerging challenges in the increasingly digital development ecosystem.
