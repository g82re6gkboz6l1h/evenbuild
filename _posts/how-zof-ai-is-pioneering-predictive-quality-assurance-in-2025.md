## What is Predictive QA?

Predictive QA leverages AI and machine learning to foresee and prevent errors before they arise. Unlike traditional QA that identifies issues post-occurrence, predictive QA is proactive and preemptive, making it more efficient and cost-effective.

### Key Benefits of Predictive QA:
- Enhance system reliability and performance.
- Minimize troubleshooting costs.
- Speed up time-to-market.
- Improve customer satisfaction by reducing bugs and failure rates.

Predictive QA proves especially impactful in enterprise settings, ensuring workflow efficiency and smooth technology integration.
