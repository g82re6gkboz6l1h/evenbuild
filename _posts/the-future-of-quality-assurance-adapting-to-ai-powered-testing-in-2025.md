## How AI is Rethinking Traditional QA Practices

Traditional QA methods relied heavily on manual labor and rigid automation scripts, often unable to adapt to evolving application environments. AI revolutionizes these traditional methods by introducing machine learning algorithms capable of:

- Recognizing failure patterns
- Providing real-time solutions
- Adapting test cases to dynamic environments

AI not only accelerates testing cycles but also enhances precision by predicting potential defects and optimizing performance. By 2025, the shift to AI-powered QA will be the norm, enabling teams to meet ambitious delivery timelines and higher quality standards.
