## Why QA Metrics Must Evolve Now

Traditional QA metrics like defect tracking and compliance checks are insufficient in addressing today’s complex systems. In a world driven by AI, microservices, and hybrid cloud solutions, these models fail to predict and prevent quality-related risks effectively. Here’s why businesses must rethink their QA approach:  

- **Complex Ecosystems**: Modern systems operate within intricate environments that require advanced metrics to ensure seamless integration and performance.
- **From Quality Control to Quality Intelligence**: QA now focuses on predictive insights and risk management rather than reactive error detection.

Businesses that embrace new-age metrics will have the advantage of delivering higher-quality systems that align with user requirements while maintaining agility.
