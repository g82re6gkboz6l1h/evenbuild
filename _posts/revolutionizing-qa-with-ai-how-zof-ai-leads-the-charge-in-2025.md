## Why AI is Essential for Modern Quality Assurance

Agile and DevOps principles have drastically accelerated development timelines, requiring QA processes to adapt rapidly. Manual testing, reliant on human effort, cannot match the velocity or complexity of today’s development demands. AI in QA is solving this challenge by enabling:
- Rapid and accurate defect detection.
- Predictive analytics to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
- Scalability to handle intricate systems such as APIs, microservices, and cloud platforms.

Discover how **Zof AI** enhances every aspect of Quality Assurance with AI-driven automation.
